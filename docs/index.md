# Welcome to DressPay Documentation!

!!! attention "The project is under heavy development!"
    The project is in the testing phase and does not support any actual transactions, and many functions are not fully implemented. Please keep an eye on the latest developments of the project.

## Goal

The main goal of DressPay is to create a payment gateway to pay merchants' bills by uploading and contributing cute dress photos.

## Structure

The main structure of the project consists of three parts:

- [DressPay Payment Gateway Backend](https://github.com/DressPay/dresspay-backend)
- [DressPay Payment Gateway Frontend](https://github.com/DressPay/dresspay-frontend)
- DressPay Verification Portal (Soon&trade;)

In addition, we also provide integrations/plugins for different platforms. You can find them in [Integration](/integration) page.
